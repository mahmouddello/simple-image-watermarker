# Simple Image Watermarker 

## Introduction
A watermarking GUI app created with Python is a user-friendly tool that allows you to easily add watermarks to images. 
Watermarks are semi-transparent or transparent logos graphics that are superimposed onto images to protect them or indicate ownership. 
This app provides a graphical interface where users can select image and watermark, and apply the watermark to an image with just a few clicks. 
It's a convenient way to personalize and protect your images before sharing or publishing them online.

## Example
### Home Page
<img src="./example_photos/home_01.png">

### Select Image and Apply the Watermark
<img src="./example_photos/before_after_02.png">

### Save Image

<img src="./example_photos/saved_03.png">

## Usage
* Friendly UI, Click on "Upload Image" Button and select your image.
* Next Step is to select the watermark or the logo, you should consider that your logo needs to be transparent or ready to use.
* You will face two frames on the screen; how the image would look before and after.
* Click "Save" and choose the location to save the new image.
